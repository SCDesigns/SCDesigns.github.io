Ask anyone who's done so much as learned how to write "Hello, World!" in their browser about their aspirations - they'll regale you with tales of the app they'll one day build, the social revolution it'll evoke, and maybe even sketch out a clever lowercase logo with a one word name. Okay, so maybe it's not something all of us are thinking about every moment of every day, (or is it? asking for a friend...) but it's certainly something that many can relate to, and I'd argue for such people, it exists as a significant force behind their passion.

As I began to plan out my Sinatra Application, I pondered what perhaps a much more advanced version of my project might look like, while perhaps unattainable at my current skill level, it would serve as a benchmark I would hope to one day meet. In fact I like to imagine one day I may look back at this application as the infantile stages of something much more meaningnful. In that vein I created "Branch" which would serve as a community application based around uniting people for events, meet-ups, and other such community action.

In the context of a Sinatra Content Management System, this would come in the form of a community board for organizations and individuals to create and broadcast events to members in their area. As it stands, users can create accounts and view all events posted by all users with editing and deletion privledges strictly allowed by those who've created the events.

Challenges regarding this project mainly revolved around my developing understanding of manipulating databases and correctly accessing data. In particular making sure editing and deletion processses were dependent on validation, as well as providing the correct feedback and functionality given these cases was perhaps where I struggled the most. Ideally, in the future, I'd look to expand the functionality to allow for user parameters such as location and preference to come into play and to cultivate opportunities for user interaction.

While perhaps not quite the next unicorn, Branch is something I'd love to bring to it's full potential some day - both to serve as a reminder for how far my work has come and to bring my idea to full realization. Nevertheless, it's an exciting feeling knowing you've made another significant step in fully manifesting an idea and is a feeling I look to continue to experience. Here's to the road ahead!
