Command lines represent a very real and incrimental step in the realm of coding. Many of us, myself included, have plently of experience engaging with command lines from the user perspective by virtue of the internet age. Today the lines might be slightly blurred and the implementation less obvious than before but the guiding principles behind the command line remain - the user is visually prompted for input in order to interact within the program's design.

This being my first foray into designing a fully functional command line program, I was curious what errors would occur and what I, as a user, had previously taken for granted in the past. For my particular project I wanted to deal with data that dynamic in nature and would (in the event of coder's block) consist of information that I particularly enjoyed dealing with. This intersection came in the form of the Billboard Hot 100, the definitive ranking of the 100 most streamed, downloaded, purchased, and well... however else people listen to music these days. 

Because Billboard updates it's rankings on a weekly basis, I felt it gave the program added novelty and in some sense provided and additional incentive for me to complete the program as it could serve a purpose beyond the date of it's creation. Thankfully, this was the case as I certainly dealt with my fair share of issues in the design, in particular with the scraping and processing of data. 

Being relatively novice in the practice of scraping, many of my struggles came from trying to comprehend why some instances of my "**TopSong::Song**" class would return values for the entire array of songs. Formating my programs' output in order to handle this instance and implementing more accurate selectors through the use of native Google Chrome Developer Tools would allow me to overcome this hurdle.

In review, while I may have felt like I had exhaused any possible solutions at certain points I was glad that ultimately I was able to overcome my errors as I'm sure I won't soon be making them again. I'm certain this won't be the last of my experience with command lines, however I wouldn't mind a little less coder's block next time.
